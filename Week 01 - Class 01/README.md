4. Code Sketches: Look through the example "math" or "graphics" apps that came with openFrameworks (inside examples/graphics or examples/math). Choose one example app and copy the code to a new app you create. Now modify the code! Experiment - try "breaking" the code. Try making the app do something different in subtle or extreme ways.
