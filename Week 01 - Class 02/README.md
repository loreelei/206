MEDIART 206: Computer Graphics - openFrameworks
	
Fall Session 2 2021	 

Week 01 - Class 02

# Setup


## 1. Download openFrameworks

Go to [openFrameworks.cc/download](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and download the OF version that matches your platform (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

Unzip this file. You'll see a folder like `of_v0.11.0_osx_release`, which contains everything you need to use openFrameworks. 

I recommend placing OF on your Desktop or Documents so it's easily accessible, i.e. `~/Documents/of_v0.11.0_osx_release`.  You can also rename the folder to something nicer like `~/Documents/openFrameworks` if you want.


## 2. Setup your IDE

Your IDE - "integrated development environment" - is where you will write and build your openFrameworks applications.

#### Mac OS:
Use **Xcode** as your IDE.  
[Follow these instructions](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/) on the openFrameworks website to get set up with Xcode.  

#### Windows:
You'll use **Visual Studio Community 2017**.  [Follow these instructions](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/) to get set up.


## 3. Install Git

Git is the "version control" software we will use to keep track of our code, and share it with each other.  
We will be use Git on the command line (i.e. through Terminal on a Mac).

Here's how to install Git:

#### macOS:

Install Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com and the command line tool.


#### Windows:

Install Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com

OR

Download the installer from [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  This will install Git, as well as __Git Bash__, which you will use as your command line interface to control Git.


## 4. Clone this repository

Use Github Desktop to clone the class repository. This will be demonstrated in class.

Now clone this repository:

https://github.com/benjaminbacon/ComputerGraphics2020

The repository will clone to your `~/Documents/GitHub/ComputerGraphics2020` directory.

### Demonstration

We will demonstrate in class how to clone and where your files are on your computer.

Clone, Push and Pull. How to upload your homework.

### Terminal (using the command line):

- **cd folder** change directory to a folder inside the current directory
- **cd ..** go back one directory
- **ls** list what's in the current directory
- **ls -a** list everything in the directory, _including hidden files_

### C++ Basics and Overview of openFrameworks (ofBook)

- [Philosophy](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html)
- [C++ Language Basics](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) 
- [oF structure](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/setup_and_project_structure.html)

### Object Oriented Programming:

 - we use **classes** to represent _types_ of things, "encapsulated" in neat packages
 - **objects** are the actual things themselves
 - classes can **inherit** from each other
 - we **declare** the class's functions and variables with a header (.h or .hpp) file - this is like a table of contents
 - we **define** the class functions inside a .cpp file

### openFrameworks apps: 

 - use OF Project Generator to create a new OF app
 - OF apps always have a main.cpp, ofApp.h, and ofApp.cpp
 - define your window dimensions in main.cpp
 - in ofApp:
     - setup() runs once, at start of app
     - update() loops until you quit - this is where you do calculations, etc.
     - draw() loops until you quit - this is where you draw things to screen

## Example apps (in this folder):

_To load these apps, use the Github Desktop to update your local copy of this repository_

These apps just contain the code.  You need to use OF Project Generator to create the project in your IDE.  

Open OF Project Generator, and click Import.  Then select the app folder (i.e. "bouncingBall").  Then click Update button, and open in IDE.

 - **bouncingBall** demonstrates how to create a Ball class
 - **manyBouncingBalls** demos how to create a vector of Balls 
 - **squareBalls** demos how to create a SquareBall class that _inherits_ from the Ball class

## Homework:

Review C++ Basics
- [C++ Language Basics](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) 
- [ideone](https://ideone.com)

READ the following chapters of the ofBook:

 - [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)
 - [OOPs!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html) <<< this is a deeper explanation of what we did in class
 - [How oF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)

USE this knowledge to create a few experimental apps of your own:

1.    Create a simple animation using a class of your own design.  You can use the Ball class as a template for your code.  
    Play with color, shape, size, movement, speed, etc.  
          - the class you write should contain both an update() and a draw() function  
        - try to use a vector in your app to contain multiple copies of the class  

2.    **Try** to make an **interactive** application using the mouse or keyboard
    - for example, how would you create a new ball when the user clicks the mouse?
    - Hint: look through the other default functions in ofApp.cpp, especially ofApp::mouseReleased(), and ofApp::keyReleased()

3.     [Extra] Look through the example "math" or "graphics" apps that came with openFrameworks (inside examples/graphics or examples/math)  
    Choose one example app, and copy the code to a new app you create.  Now modify the code!  Experiment - try "breaking" the code.  Try making the app do something different in subtle or extreme ways.
